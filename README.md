Project Description:
The Automatic Prank Spoon is a fun and mischievous device designed to surprise anyone attempting to eat with it. This project uses an Arduino UNO, a servo motor, and a sensor to detect when a person picks up the spoon. Once detected, the servo motor rotates suddenly, causing the spoon to catapult the food toward the user’s face, leading to a hilarious and unexpected mess!

How It Works:
Object Detection: A proximity sensor (e.g., infrared or ultrasonic sensor) detects when a hand grabs the spoon.
Servo Motor Activation: The servo motor, connected to the spoon, quickly rotates when triggered.
Food Launch: The sudden movement flings the food toward the user's face, creating a playful prank moment.
Reset Mechanism: The spoon automatically returns to its original position, ready for the next victim.
Components Used:
Arduino UNO – The brain of the project.
Servo Motor – Rotates the spoon.
 Ultrasonic sensor – Detects when a hand approaches.
Battery Pack – Powers the system.

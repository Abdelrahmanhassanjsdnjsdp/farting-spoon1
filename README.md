# Automatic Prank Spoon

##  Project Overview
The **Automatic Prank Spoon** is a fun and mischievous device designed to surprise anyone trying to eat with it. Using an **Arduino UNO**, a **servo motor**, and a ** Ultra sonicsensor**, the spoon detects when a person grabs it. Once triggered, the servo motor rotates suddenly, **catapulting the food toward the user’s face**, resulting in a hilarious prank!

---

## How It Works
1. **Object Detection:** A **proximity sensor** (e.g., infrared or ultrasonic sensor) detects when a hand picks up the spoon.
2. **Servo Motor Activation:** The **servo motor**, connected to the spoon, quickly rotates upon detection.
3. **Food Launch:** The sudden movement **flings the food toward the user’s face** for a playful prank.
4. **Reset Mechanism:** The spoon automatically returns to its original position, ready for the next victim.
